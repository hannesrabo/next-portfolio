This is the source code for my portfolio site available at <https://hannesrabo.github.io>.

## Running the code

To run the code for development purposes run:

```bash
> yarn install
> yarn start
```

## Building static

Exporting the page for static hosting can be done using

```bash
> yarn build 		# builds icons and then web page
> yarn export		# Create static export from site
```

## Debugging static

Sometimes there is a difference in statically exported pages compared to the dynamic development environment. A static http server has to be installed and the npm package `http-serve` was used here. To test the export before committing use:

```bash
> npm install -g http-server
> yarn stest
```

## Look into:

Things that are coming in the future:

-   [ ] Add linting and reformat hook
-   [ ] Dynamic SVG generation
-   [ ] Look into integrating: https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/lighthousebot
